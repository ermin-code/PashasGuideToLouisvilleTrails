Code Louisville - May 2021 Class - Final Project - Ermin Vila
Project Name: Pasha's Guide to Louisville Trails

This website is dedicated to my dog Pasha that passed away last year. Him and I hiked a lot. I wanted to share some of our adventures and hopefully motivate people to get a dog and enjoy Louisville outdoors. Even though my website is still not complete yet, in the meantime I hope that you will enjoy looking at some of our hiking pictures.

For Code Louisville: 

- JavaScript Requirement: SlideShow

- CSS Requirement: Hamburger Menu

- Additional picked requirement: Animated Menu Buttons and Animated SlideSow and Paragraph (they slightly move downward on mouse hover), Note: I also attempted to write form validation for Name value. Script code is embedded in HTML but unfortunately I was not able to get it to work. 

- Media Query Optimization for Mobile Phones and Tablets: All pages have been optimized for mobile phone screens up to 480px except About Me page (it worked before but after I moved around some elements in CSS, picture and first paragraph got out of format in mobile view). I also optimized index.html (Main Page) and About Me page for tablets but I ran out of time to optimize rest of the pages. As you scroll from desktop to mobile view, you will see that menu buttons change location as well as slideshows and paragraphs to fit mobile view.
